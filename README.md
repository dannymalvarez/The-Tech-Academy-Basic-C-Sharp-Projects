# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
This repo will be used to store various code from the C-Sharp course in my bootcamp. Code will range from following along in projects to assignments.
## Notable Projects / Concepts
### CarInsurance
This was a web app that took in user info and calculated a quote based on that input. 

### Many of these apps were console apps
I enjoyed the console apps the more I worked with them as I got to understand the basics pretty quickly. 
Really it boiled down to seeing and repeating the same basic concepts such as Console.ReadLine/WriteLine. 

### Overloading constructors
ConstructorSubmission was pretty tough for me to grasp but once I got it it made sense. 
It was one of those concepts that until I spent more and more time with my errors and mistakes, and with instructor help, I was able to understand it.
Generally, objects and classes and such have been pretty tough for me but C# really helped me understand those concepts more. 

### Some Lambda practice
Lambda expressions were introduced in this course. I had seen this concept before in a JS course elsewhere but it made no sense then.
A lot of my time in this bootcamp has been learning and accepting that spending more time in the unknown of the tech world is how 
I will learn and grow more comfortable with it. Which has some growing pains but I have come to see that they are worth it when you 
manage to complete your task and see how and why it works the way it does. 

### Try/Catch / Error Handling
I had seen this in another course but got some more practice with it. This course was pretty heavy on hands-on projects throughout the course
which allowed me to repeatedly see how these apps were spun up and such. Now I am more aware of the importance of error handling and trying to 
think like the user. After all, the user's needs are very important. 

### The other projects were MVC web apps. 
What I liked about this was that it reminded me of Django in how it can be used to make websites. 
Seeing things come together and work smoothly was satisfying especially when I knew what all went into making it work. 
I used to be apprehensive at the idea of working on websites because my creativity is more in the details of what I am doing
and how I am doing it for something functional. But having frameworks really helps me feel more comfortable and confident working with sites. 
I didn't really realize how much went into them besides content and css. 

### Takeaway
At first I was a bit intimidated by C#, not that I have it down at this point, but I was able to get a good foundational understanding of it. 
The more time I spent on it I became even more comfortable and things made sense as I went on. 
With how verbose it is, it helped me keep track of my variables and what I wanted to do as their data type mattered and had to be declared. 
Having those requirements from the course sharpened my problem solving skills.
