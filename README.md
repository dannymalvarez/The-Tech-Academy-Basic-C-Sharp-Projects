# The-Tech-Academy-Basic-C-Sharp-Projects
This repo will be used to store various code from the C-Sharp course in my bootcamp. Code will range from following along in projects to assignments.
## Notable Projects / Concepts
### CarInsurance
This was a web app that took in user info and calculated a quote based on that input. 

### Many of these apps were console apps
I enjoyed the console apps the more I worked with them as I got to understand the basics pretty quickly. 
Really it boiled down to seeing and repeating the same basic concepts such as Console.ReadLine/WriteLine. 

### Takeaway
At first I was a bit intimidated by C#, not that I have it down at this point, but I was able to get a good foundational understanding of it. 
The more time I spent on it I became even more comfortable and things made sense as I went on. 
With how verbose it is, it helped me keep track of my variables and what I wanted to do as their data type mattered and had to be declared. 
Having those requirements from the course sharpened my problem solving skills.
